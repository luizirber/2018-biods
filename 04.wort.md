# wort

wort is a database for sourmash signatures, providing APIs to allow searching
public genomic databases for dataset similarity, performing taxonomic
classification of samples and submission of signatures for inclusion in search
indexes.

wort also aims to explore data locality on networks to overcome the bandwidth
limitations in centralized databases, and move data preprocessing into web
browsers using WebAssembly to allow novel solutions where the user data doesn't
need to leave their computers to be able to participate in the ecosystem.

The main goal for wort is to create a resource that allows permissive
improvements without depending on central coordination, using decentralized web
technologies like IPFS [Benet, 2014] and dat [Ogden, 2017] as building blocks.

Currently there are 686k microbial SRA runs and 65k JGI-IMG datasets available
for download in wort. They can be downloaded using the public HTTP API, via IPFS
or dat. We are also moving the sourmash prepared indexes to wort, providing
RefSeq and GenBank signatures too.
