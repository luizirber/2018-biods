# Introduction

Traditional algorithms for searching genomic sequences don't scale well for the
large public genomic databases currently available. With data archives like the
SRA reaching multiple petabases of data and with decreasing costs for sequencing
the rate of data generation is only increasing, and new computational methods
are necessary. Sequence Bloom Trees [Solomon, 2016] allow searching for specific
sequences in large databases, opening a path to solve other problems with
similar data structures.

On top of the data discoverability problem, data access is also another issue.
Downloading and sharing large collections don't take advantage of subsets of the
data available outside the central servers hosting the full data, and
traditional solutions involve explicit caches that need to be maintained and
updated frequently.
