# sourmash signatures

A sourmash signature is a collection of MinHash sketches from the same original
dataset but with distinct parameters. A MinHash sketch [Broder, 1997] is a data
structure that allows fast similarity and containment estimates for datasets,
first used by Mash [Ondov, 2016] for genomic data. In sourmash we extended
MinHash sketches to take the complexity of the dataset into account and make it
possible to compare from microbial genomes to metagenomes. These signatures are
most useful when they are easily available, especially for public genomic
databases like RefSeq or the SRA.

sourmash also includes a Sequence Bloom Tree implementation for indexing
MinHashes, allowing both searching for similarity and taxonomic classification
of datasets. But there is no functionality to make it easier to share these
indexes, and it is up to the user to send these sketches around or build their
own indexes.
